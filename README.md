# Prototypes for Expert Lab
This GitHub contains all the prototypes I made for Expert Lab.

## Camera
This branch is about the camera angle and settings I want to use in my final work.
Here I tested how to turn a 3D camera into a 2D view.

## Character
This branch is about the character system I want to use in my final work.

There are 4 different characters with all different abilities. The player can swap between them using the 1-4 keys.
There are 2 different ways of displaying the characters, switch is showing all characters and when the player swaps character they take over the control of the chosen character while the others follow the player. Change characters shows only the activated characters, if the player swaps character the old character switches into the new character.

The animation folder is a test how I can implement models and animation into this system without any troubles.

## Level
This branch is about different levels I can use in my final work.

The folder basic level is about the basics of a level. How the switching between abilities works and the enemy.

The folder music level contains different types of music levels I can use. 
Firstly there is the Echolocation level. Here the player finds the exit by listening where the audio comes from. I have 2 different types of randomisation here, one where the doors spawn at random and one where the music spawns at random in a certain amount of locations (the doors).
Then there is also the music swap level, here the level changes depending on which music is playing in the level.
